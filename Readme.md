PF2 Helper
----------

This is an Roll20 API script designed to help running Pathfinder Second Edition. It has three main features:

* Parsing of NPCs/Monsters from Paizo PDFs and monster.pf2.tools json
* Hiding of enemy rolls, names, and more correct handling of criticals (including deadly and fatal)
* Making secret rolls easier

Installation
------------
As it's still in development, PF2 Helper is not available directly from Roll20. To use it, you need a Roll20 Plus account, add an API script to your game, and then copy-paste the contents of [pf2_helper.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tompudding/roll20_pf2_helper/master/pf2_helper.js) into the editor window of Roll20, and hit "Save Script"
