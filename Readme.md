PF2 Helper
----------

This is an Roll20 API script designed to help running Pathfinder Second Edition. It has three main features:

* Parsing of NPCs/Monsters from Paizo PDFs and monster.pf2.tools json
* Hiding of enemy rolls, names, and more correct handling of criticals (including deadly and fatal)
* Making secret rolls easier
