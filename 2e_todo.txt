Bugs:
-----

**done** Sandpoint attack of opportunes doesn't parse
**skip** Parsing DC 41 as a dice expression
         First parse on a new character has the spell type toggles flipped
         We sometimes have core rulebook references left in the spell name
         Gamemastery Guide has unicode instead of action symbols which breaks things
