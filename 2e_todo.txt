Bugs:
-----
**done** Ability buttons are messed up
**done** Sandpoint attack of opportunes doesn't parse
**skip** Parsing DC 41 as a dice expression
**done** First parse on a new character has the spell type toggles flipped
**done** 2nd and subsequent parses can mess up attack order
         We sometimes have core rulebook references left in the spell name
         Gamemastery Guide has unicode instead of action symbols which breaks things
**done** Dero Stalker has some spell problems
         comma separated lists inside brackets in spells mess us up (e.g on the Balisse)
